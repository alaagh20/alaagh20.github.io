        <h2>Founder</h2>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12  col-md-12">
            <img src="./Images/founder.jpg" class="founder-Image"/>
            <p><strong>Marwan F. Al-Masri</strong> was born in 1925 in Nablus, Palestine. He completed his   early education at Salahiyyah School in Nablus. In 1943, he went to   Cairo to pursue higher education in the field of Electrical Engineering   at King Fuad I University, which was renamed after 1952 revolution to   Cairo University.</p>
            <p>After his graduation in 1948, he went to Ramallah and worked for the Palestine Broadcasting Service.</p>
            <p>Few   years later, he moved to Amman and worked at the Amman Technical School   before heading to Kuwait in 1956 where he took a post at the Kuwait Oil   Company. After 17 fruitful years in Kuwait, he decided in 1973 to go   back to Amman to establish his own trading business, Jordan Bautak   Company (JBC).</p>
            <p>In   the first few years, the main scope of the business was the import and   distribution of equipment and machinery. A change in the business   strategy took place few years later when Mr. Al-Masri decided to use his   25 year experience in the electrical field and switched to import and   distribution of electrical supplies. In the following 10 years, Mr.   Al-Masri succeeded to establish Jordan Bautak Company as a major   supplier to the Jordanian market.</p>
            <p>The   business grew during the 90s, accelerated by the mass repatriation of   Jordanians from the Gulf countries. This was accompanied by a   construction boom and heightened demand in all forms of electrical   supplies which JBC was ready to cater for.</p>
            <p>It   was during this fast growing period that both of his sons joined the   company and got the exposure and training needed to run and further grow   the business.</p>
            <p>Upon his passing in 2003, Mr. Al-Masri left one of the biggest and well established electrical supplies companies in Jordan.</p>
